---------------------

The analyses contained in this file can be used for the integration of fiber photometry data collected using a Neurophotometrics Fiber Photometry system and behavioural data processed using [SimBA](https://goldenneurolab.com/simba).

Depending on the version of the Neurophotometrics Bonsai app being used, data may need to be reorganized or reference column numbers changed in the script itself.

The authors take no credit or responsability for the development of SimBA. Should users decide to use these analyses, we encourage the authors to also cite the most up to date version of the [SimBA manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.049452v2).

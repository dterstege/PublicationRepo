## Cavalieri Point Mask

**Cavalieri Point Mask** is an *ImageJ* Plugin which converts images of biological tissues into masks of evenly spaced binary points for the sake of applying a Cavalieri-based point-counting approach to area approximation.

This Plugin has been made available at the [linked GitHub repository](https://github.com/dterstege/CavalieriPointMask)

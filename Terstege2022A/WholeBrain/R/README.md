Script for WholeBrain Processing in R
=====================================

The script in this section will produce outputs suited for the [MATLAB analysis](https://github.com/dterstege/PublicationRepo/tree/main/Terstege2022A/WholeBrain/MATLAB).

As per the [*About* page](http://www.wholebrainsoftware.org/cms/sample-page/) of the WholeBrain Software Suite

> WholeBrain is conceived and created by Daniel FÃ¼rth, during his PhD in Konstantinos Meletis lab, at Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet.
 
> Daniel is now a postdoctoral researcher in Jay Lee's lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory working on next-generation of in situ sequencing methods.

> WholeBrain is intended as a software suite, meaning a collection of computer programs sharing a common interface and ability to integrate and exchange data with each other.

> The purpose of WholeBrain is to provide a user-friendly and efficient way for scientist with minimal knowledge of computers to create anatomical maps and integrate this information with behavioral and physiological data for sharing on the web.

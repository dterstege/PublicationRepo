Atlas Files
===========

**WB_Atlas.mat** corresponds to the highest level organization of the Allen Institute's Mouse Brain Atlas (2011).  The outputs align directly with the level used in WholeBrain, but they are sorted hierachically by default.

**User_Atlas_98reg.mat** serves as a template for user atlas organization.  Note that in the publication, region RSCagl was removed from this file the analysis as the region was not present in all datasets
